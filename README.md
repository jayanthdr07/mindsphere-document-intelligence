AI-powered document intelligence system to detect hidden contradictions in policy documents.



# MindSphere – Document Intelligence with Contradiction Detection

**Team:** MindSphere  
**Tagline:** Where Intelligence Meets Innovation  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
**PS-2: Document Intelligence with Contradiction Detection**

Large contracts, policy documents, and institutional guidelines often contain **hidden contradictions** due to multiple revisions, complex language, and manual drafting. These contradictions can lead to **compliance issues, legal disputes, and ambiguity**. Manual review is slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**MindSphere** is an **AI-powered document intelligence system** that automatically analyzes large contracts and policy documents to **detect and explain hidden contradictions at the clause level**.

Instead of relying on keyword matching, MindSphere uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** to understand the *semantic meaning* of clauses and identify conflicts such as:
- Obligations vs prohibitions  
- Conflicting timelines  
- Conditional inconsistencies  

The system provides **clear, explainable outputs** that help users quickly understand where and why contradictions occur.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate analysis of large policy and contract documents  
- Detect semantic contradictions across clauses  
- Provide explainable, human-readable results  
- Reduce manual review time and compliance risks  
- Build a scalable and real-world applicable solution  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Upload policy or contract documents (TXT / PDF*)
- Automatic clause segmentation
- AI-based semantic contradiction detection
- Confidence score for detected contradictions
- Explainable output for better understanding
- Working MVP with live demo capability
